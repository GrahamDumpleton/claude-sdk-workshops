# Stream the reply as it is written

An agent is a model with a program around it, here the Claude Agent
SDK. Your code reads a run as a stream of messages, and so far each
reply from the model has been one of them: an `AssistantMessage` that
arrives complete.

A model does not write a reply all at once. It produces it a token at
a time, a token being a piece of text about the size of a short word,
and a long answer takes several seconds to finish. If nothing is shown
until the last token is written, the person waiting looks at an empty
space for all of that time, and has no way to tell a slow answer from
a program that has stopped.

Every chat application you have used deals with this the same way: it
shows the words as they are written. That is called streaming, and
this workshop turns it on, looks at what arrives, and prints a reply
as it is produced.

## What it runs on

The SDK calls the model with the Claude login on this machine, the one
the `claude` command uses. Every run counts against that plan's usage,
as a message in the Claude app does. This workshop makes four small
runs on the smallest model, three of which ask for a few paragraphs of
text.

```{when} "claude" in missing_tools
The `claude` command was not found. The SDK carries its own copy of
Claude Code, so the workshop still works if this machine has logged in
before. If the login check further down fails, install
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup), run `claude` in a
terminal and log in.
```

## The notebook

The step below creates the notebook. Its first cell imports what the
workshop uses.

```{notebook-create}
:id: create-notebook
:path: {{ notebook }}
:open: true
- markdown: |
    # Stream the reply as it is written
    Each step of the workshop adds a cell below.
- code: |
    import time
    from dataclasses import replace

    import claude_agent_sdk
    from claude_agent_sdk import (
        AssistantMessage,
        ClaudeAgentOptions,
        ResultMessage,
        StreamEvent,
        TextBlock,
        query,
    )

    sdk_version = claude_agent_sdk.__version__
    print("claude-agent-sdk:", sdk_version)
  tags: [setup]
```

```{cell-run}
:id: run-setup
:path: {{ notebook }}
:cell: setup
```

The cell prints the version of the SDK this JupyterLab has installed.

```{verify}
:id: sdk-ready
:label: The SDK is importable
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: after:run-setup; cell-executed setup
bool(sdk_version)
```

## Check the login

Before anything else, make sure the SDK can reach the model. The cell
below asks the agent for one word. It takes a few seconds, as every
cell that calls the model does: the wait is the model working.

```{cell-insert}
:id: insert-login
:path: {{ notebook }}
:tags: [login]
:run: true
ready = False

try:
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Reply with the single word: ready",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            model="haiku",
            system_prompt="Reply with one word.",
            tools=[],
            setting_sources=[],
            strict_mcp_config=True,
            thinking={"type": "disabled"},
            max_turns=1,
        ),
    ):
        if isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
            ready = not message.is_error
            print("the model replied:", message.result)
except Exception as error:
    print("the run failed:", error)

print("ready:", ready)
```

The last line prints `ready: True` when the model answered.

```{verify}
:id: login-works
:label: The SDK can reach the model with your login
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: cell-executed login
if not ready:
    print("The run did not reach the model. Open the hint below, then run the cell again.")
ready
```

```{hint}
:title: If it says you are not logged in
The SDK found no Claude login on this machine. In a terminal, run
`claude`, type `/login` and sign in with a Claude Pro, Max, Team or
Enterprise account, then run the cell again from the notebook. The
command `claude auth status` shows whether a login is in place.

An API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable also works,
and is used in preference to a login when it is set. Runs are then
billed to that key.
```

```{hint}
:title: What the options in that cell are for
`query()` runs an agent once and hands back messages as the run goes
on. `model="haiku"` picks the smallest model, `system_prompt` is the
standing instruction the agent works under, `tools=[]` gives it no
tools, and `max_turns` stops a run that goes wrong.

`setting_sources=[]` and `strict_mcp_config=True` keep your own Claude
configuration out of the run, so the agent behaves the same on every
machine. `thinking={"type": "disabled"}` turns off a step in which the
model reasons privately before it answers, which these tasks do not
need. Every agent in these workshops sets all three.
```
