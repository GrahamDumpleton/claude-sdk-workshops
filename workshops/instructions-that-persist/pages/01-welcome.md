# Give instructions that persist

An agent is a model with a program around it, and the model does what
the text in front of it says. So far these workshops have put
instructions in two places:

- **The prompt** is the request: what you want done this time.

- **The system prompt** is the standing instruction your code sends
  ahead of every request: who the agent is and how it should behave.

There is a third place, and this workshop is about it: **a file in the
project**. A file named `CLAUDE.md` in the directory the agent works
in holds instructions for any agent that works there. The SDK can load
it into every session without your code quoting a word of it.

Why keep instructions in a file when the system prompt is right there
in the code? Because rules about a project belong with the project.
They can be read and changed by people who never open your program,
they are the same for every agent and every person who uses Claude
Code in that directory, and they are kept in version control beside
the things they describe.

The file for this workshop is {open}`CLAUDE.md`, open beside the
notebook: the house rules of a small bookshop, Tidewater Books, for
anything written to a customer. Read it now. It is four rules long.

## What it runs on

The SDK calls the model with the Claude login on this machine, the one
the `claude` command uses. Every run counts against that plan's usage,
as a message in the Claude app does. This workshop makes three small
runs on the smallest model.

The agent is given no tools. It writes a short reply and does nothing
else.

```{when} "claude" in missing_tools
The `claude` command was not found. The SDK carries its own copy of
Claude Code, so the workshop still works if this machine has logged in
before. If the login check further down fails, install
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup), run `claude` in a
terminal and log in.
```

## The notebook

The step below creates the notebook. Its first cell imports what the
workshop uses.

```{notebook-create}
:id: create-notebook
:path: {{ notebook }}
:open: true
- markdown: |
    # Give instructions that persist
    Each step of the workshop adds a cell below.
- code: |
    from pathlib import Path

    import claude_agent_sdk
    from claude_agent_sdk import (
        AssistantMessage,
        ClaudeAgentOptions,
        ClaudeSDKClient,
        ResultMessage,
        query,
    )

    sdk_version = claude_agent_sdk.__version__
    print("claude-agent-sdk:", sdk_version)
  tags: [setup]
```

```{cell-run}
:id: run-setup
:path: {{ notebook }}
:cell: setup
```

The cell prints the version of the SDK this JupyterLab has installed.

```{verify}
:id: sdk-ready
:label: The SDK is importable
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: after:run-setup; cell-executed setup
bool(sdk_version)
```

## Check the login

Before anything else, make sure the SDK can reach the model. The cell
below asks the agent for one word. It takes a few seconds, as every
cell that calls the model does: the wait is the model working.

```{cell-insert}
:id: insert-login
:path: {{ notebook }}
:tags: [login]
:run: true
ready = False

try:
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Reply with the single word: ready",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            model="haiku",
            system_prompt="Reply with one word.",
            tools=[],
            setting_sources=[],
            strict_mcp_config=True,
            thinking={"type": "disabled"},
            max_turns=1,
        ),
    ):
        if isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
            ready = not message.is_error
            print("the model replied:", message.result)
except Exception as error:
    print("the run failed:", error)

print("ready:", ready)
```

The last line prints `ready: True` when the model answered.

```{verify}
:id: login-works
:label: The SDK can reach the model with your login
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: cell-executed login
if not ready:
    print("The run did not reach the model. Open the hint below, then run the cell again.")
ready
```

```{hint}
:title: If it says you are not logged in
The SDK found no Claude login on this machine. In a terminal, run
`claude`, type `/login` and sign in with a Claude Pro, Max, Team or
Enterprise account, then run the cell again from the notebook. The
command `claude auth status` shows whether a login is in place.

An API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable also works,
and is used in preference to a login when it is set. Runs are then
billed to that key.
```

```{hint}
:title: What the options in that cell are for
`query()` runs an agent once and hands back messages as the run goes
on. `model="haiku"` picks the smallest model, `system_prompt` is the
standing instruction the agent works under, `tools=[]` gives it no
tools, and `max_turns` stops a run that goes wrong.

`setting_sources=[]` and `strict_mcp_config=True` keep your own Claude
configuration out of the run, so the agent behaves the same on every
machine. `thinking={"type": "disabled"}` turns off a step in which the
model reasons privately before it answers, which these tasks do not
need. Every agent in these workshops sets all three.
```
