# Connect an MCP server

An agent is a model with a program around it. The model asks for
tools, and the program, here the Claude Agent SDK, carries the
requests out.

**Give the agent a tool of your own** wrote a tool as a Python
function inside the program that ran the agent. That is the quickest
way, and it has a limit: the tool exists only in that one program.
Another program, or another kind of agent, cannot use it.

The Model Context Protocol, MCP for short, is the answer to that. It
is an open standard for how a program offers tools to an agent. A
program that offers tools this way is called an MCP server, and an
agent that uses them is a client. Because both sides follow the same
standard, a server written once works with any client: with the SDK,
with Claude Code, with the Claude apps, and with agents that are not
Claude at all. There are servers already written for databases, issue
trackers, file stores and a great many other things, and connecting
one is a few lines of configuration.

This workshop uses a server of that kind. It is
{open}`stock_server.py`, open beside the notebook: the same stock
lookup as before, over {open}`shop/stock.csv`, now a program of its
own that knows nothing about Claude or the SDK.

## What it runs on

The SDK calls the model with the Claude login on this machine, the one
the `claude` command uses. Every run counts against that plan's usage,
as a message in the Claude app does. This workshop makes two small
runs on the smallest model.

The server is started by the SDK, on this machine, with the Python
this notebook runs on. It reads one small file and changes nothing.

```{when} "claude" in missing_tools
The `claude` command was not found. The SDK carries its own copy of
Claude Code, so the workshop still works if this machine has logged in
before. If the login check further down fails, install
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup), run `claude` in a
terminal and log in.
```

## The notebook

The step below creates the notebook. Its first cell imports what the
workshop uses.

```{notebook-create}
:id: create-notebook
:path: {{ notebook }}
:open: true
- markdown: |
    # Connect an MCP server
    Each step of the workshop adds a cell below.
- code: |
    import asyncio
    import sys
    from dataclasses import replace

    import claude_agent_sdk
    from claude_agent_sdk import (
        AssistantMessage,
        ClaudeAgentOptions,
        ClaudeSDKClient,
        ResultMessage,
        ToolResultBlock,
        ToolUseBlock,
        UserMessage,
        query,
    )

    sdk_version = claude_agent_sdk.__version__
    print("claude-agent-sdk:", sdk_version)
  tags: [setup]
```

```{cell-run}
:id: run-setup
:path: {{ notebook }}
:cell: setup
```

The cell prints the version of the SDK this JupyterLab has installed.

```{verify}
:id: sdk-ready
:label: The SDK is importable
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: after:run-setup; cell-executed setup
bool(sdk_version)
```

## Check the login

Before anything else, make sure the SDK can reach the model. The cell
below asks the agent for one word. It takes a few seconds, as every
cell that calls the model does: the wait is the model working.

```{cell-insert}
:id: insert-login
:path: {{ notebook }}
:tags: [login]
:run: true
ready = False

try:
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Reply with the single word: ready",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            model="haiku",
            system_prompt="Reply with one word.",
            tools=[],
            setting_sources=[],
            strict_mcp_config=True,
            thinking={"type": "disabled"},
            max_turns=1,
        ),
    ):
        if isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
            ready = not message.is_error
            print("the model replied:", message.result)
except Exception as error:
    print("the run failed:", error)

print("ready:", ready)
```

The last line prints `ready: True` when the model answered.

```{verify}
:id: login-works
:label: The SDK can reach the model with your login
:substrate: learner-kernel
:path: {{ notebook }}
:trigger: cell-executed login
if not ready:
    print("The run did not reach the model. Open the hint below, then run the cell again.")
ready
```

```{hint}
:title: If it says you are not logged in
The SDK found no Claude login on this machine. In a terminal, run
`claude`, type `/login` and sign in with a Claude Pro, Max, Team or
Enterprise account, then run the cell again from the notebook. The
command `claude auth status` shows whether a login is in place.

An API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable also works,
and is used in preference to a login when it is set. Runs are then
billed to that key.
```

```{hint}
:title: What the options in that cell are for
`query()` runs an agent once and hands back messages as the run goes
on. `model="haiku"` picks the smallest model, `system_prompt` is the
standing instruction the agent works under, `tools=[]` gives it no
tools, and `max_turns` stops a run that goes wrong.

`setting_sources=[]` and `strict_mcp_config=True` keep your own Claude
configuration out of the run, so the agent behaves the same on every
machine. `thinking={"type": "disabled"}` turns off a step in which the
model reasons privately before it answers, which these tasks do not
need. Every agent in these workshops sets all three.
```
